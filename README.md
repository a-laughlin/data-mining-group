## Description of the project
What can we learn about a person from years of writing?
## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
  We decided to analyze different parts of the author’s writing. We started with a few questions:

- What can we learn about a person from their writing?
- What psychological characterics stand out?
- What linguistic characterics stand out?
- What psychological patterns are interesting?
- What linguistic patterns are interesting?

We found from his blog posts that he is overall a more positive person. His word use change over time was also analyzed, and it was found that his clout (confidence) dramatically increased while his authenticity decreased. 

## Application of this knowledge
  We can use our results to make assumptions about the author of these blog posts. Using VADAR and analyzing the positive and negative words we can conclude that he is mostly a positive person. There are countless other applications using Timeseries and NLP, such as analyzing the author’s psychological and linguistic characteristics.
